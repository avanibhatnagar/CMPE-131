Edit the files 'blogpost/app/view/application/demo.html.erb' , put html/css stuff in here .
You can view the change on your page by typing in 'localhost:3000/demo' or click on the demo link in the homepage 
To make the page responsive and have functionalites you need to add ruby code into the files  "blogpost/app/controller/application_controller.rb"

I'll make some minor changes to the landing pages and keep working on the login and signup pages. You guy can work on the demo pages. It can be a calendar pages, profiles pages, or watever you guy want.
